 Cradlepoint DNS Updater
    
    A simple Flutter app to update the DNS mode on Cradlepoint routers.
    I use this to switch from the auto DNS assigned by the ISP and
    OpenDNS to enable/disable youtube and games when the kids are
    supposed to be working with their online school.
    
    TODO:
    - Find the router IP dynamically
    - Allow the user to input and save the password instead of having it baked into code
